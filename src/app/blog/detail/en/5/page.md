+ 1. What is the symbol?
> Symbol is the 7th data type in JS, and it appears to prevent property name conflicts
   The Symbol value is generated by the Symbol function, which is unique, and the property name of this object can be either a string or a Symbol type
```javascript
    let s=Symbol(); Do not use the new command
    A support string can be accepted as a parameter to represent the description of the Symbol instance
    var s1=Symbol('foo');
    s1.toString(); //"Symbol(foo)"
    
The Symbol type can be converted to a string or a boolean, but it cannot directly participate in the operation and cannot be converted to a numeric value
```

+ 2. As the attribute name of an object, the main advantage is that when an object has multiple modules, it can avoid a key being overwritten or overwritten by mistake
```javascript
    Note that the dot operator is used, followed by a string, but Symbol is a separate data type
    var mySymbol=Symbol();
    a[mySymbol]='hello';
    
You can define some constants that don't repeat:
    e.g. let color=Symbol();
```

+ 3. You can use Symobl to define some non-private methods for objects, but there are methods that are only used internally
```javascript
    Only Object.getOwnPropertySymbols and Reflect.ownKeys can iterate over the Symbol keyname
```

+ 4, Symbol.for() and Symbol.keyFor()
```javascript
    let s1=Symbol.for('foo'); If there is a Symbol with the name 'foo', then the Symbol value is assigned directly, if not
    is new, and Symbol() is always new
    
let s2=Symbol.keyFor('foo'); Be sure to find the Symbol with the name 'foo', otherwise undefined
    
Note that the name registered for the Symbol value in Symbol.for is global.
```

+ 5. Built-in Symbol values, including 11 built-in Symbol values
```javascript
 As:
  Symbol.species, a constructor that points to the current object
  
The built-in value of Symbol is generally called by default when some methods are called,
 so that some default functions can be performed when some built-in methods are called
```
